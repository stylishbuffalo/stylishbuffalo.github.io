         <!-- This is my Bio -->
         <p style="border: 5px solid black; width: 60%;"><font size="4" face="helvetica" color="#8c8">August, 27, 2015, I decided that i wanted to make a youtube channel. I sat down and thought of names and after hours and hours of brainstorming i thought of the name "Stylish Buffalo", I liked the name and stuck with it. My first video was a tutorial video showing how to perform a certain task in photoshop, the video did well but got a lot of hate due to the video being so low quality. After a while i decided that tutorials were not my strong suit, I then decided i should play around with different genres until i was making the videos i liked. I started making animal videos, recording and uploading different videos of my animals, these did very good! They got hundreds of views per video, but i wasnt enjoying making them. I decided to try vlogging (Video Logging) but those videos didnt do good at all and they were rather boring. On July, 2, 2016, I decided to try one more genre, Challenge videos, I uploaded a video titled "1 Second Water Bottle Challenge (FAIL)" This video did not do good either so i went back to making animal videos and after a while i stopped uploading completely. A year later a channel called "Infinite Lists" uploaded a video in which he reacted to my water bottle challenge video, My video then blew up as a result, the video as of now has 15 Thousand views. I decided then i will try once more to make videos, i decided i would make comedy videos and skits, these videos did very well and are still doing well, as of today i have over 300 subscribers and am growing everyday. Comedy videos are something i very much enjoy making, and I am very glad I never gave up.</font></p>
